Invisible Inc Pilots BETA.0
Art By: Hekateras
Code By: NamesAreHard

"Unreleased" version of Invisible Inc Pilots

TODO:
Preview for Int. - Not sure how... I'm smarter now
CEO Reskin
Time the weapons for Int. - Probably Won't Do
Sharp Custom Tip Image
Change Sharp so that it works in test mech and tooltip (global variable that's updated??) - Too much work really
-1 move doesn't show properly for Dr.Xu, as it shows base move before changing. Could use MoveBonus Instead
Acid Rain Bug
Dialogue
Probably more
