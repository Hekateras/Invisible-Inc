Invisible Inc Pilots BETA.0
Art By: Hekateras
Code By: NamesAreHard

"Unreleased" version of Invisible Inc Pilots

Known Bugs:
Adding shields to buildings and Int. don't really work. Is this a bug or a feature?
	- It should at least maintain any current shields right?

Possible Untested Bugs:
Where do bonus cores go in save data? Do I add ["iBonusPower"] and ["iUsedBonus"] or not? It requires getting +1 core on sharp which is tricky

To Do List:
Preview for Int. - Not sure how...
CEO Reskin
Time the weapons for Int. - Probably Won't Do
Sharp Custom Tip Image
Sharp Repair Icon
Change Sharp so that it works in test mech and tooltip (global variable that's updated??) - Too much work really
